As HSD Software Team, we developed a dynamic and mobile-friendly website for HSD Bandırma. We designed the entire UI from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, managing version control with Git. Features include an admin panel for managing club members, "About Us" and "Vision-Mission" cards, social media and Medium links, a contact form, and email integration. The slider dynamically displays the latest five announcements from the admin panel. We also implemented a certificate verification system where certificate IDs are managed via the panel, showing results with user details. With SEO optimization, the project ensures both web and mobile compatibility.
